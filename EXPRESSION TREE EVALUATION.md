# Experiment 9(e): Expression Tree Evaluation

## Aim
To write a Python program to build and evaluate the given expression tree.

---

## Algorithm

1. Start the program.
2. Create nodes for operators and operands.
3. Build the expression tree by connecting the nodes in the correct hierarchical structure.
4. Define a recursive function `evaluate(root)`:
   - If the node is a number (leaf), return it as a float.
   - Else, recursively evaluate the left and right subtrees.
   - Apply the operator at the current node to the results.
5. Return the final result from the root node.
6. End the program.
